Makesure to have python installed to run this program you can install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You also need to have ffmeg installed on your pc, you can download it from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

The Program installs all the modules it self though if it doesn't install you can manually install them by using this command: 

```bash
  pip install flask pytubefix ffmpeg-python
```
After that you can open command line interface in the directly where this program and its files are located and run this command:
